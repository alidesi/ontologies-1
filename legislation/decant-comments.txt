The distinction made by The National Archives between made statutory instruments (legislation) and draft statutory instruments (draft legislation) is maintained by the mappings to the DraftStatutoryInstrument and MadeStatutoryInstrument classes.

Despite not (yet) being legislation, draft statutory instruments are published by The National Archives on legislation.gov.uk.

Note that draft statutory instruments do not have a full 'SI number' (citation) but do have an ISBN. A draft statutory instrument published on legislation.gov.uk will have a URI derived from this ISBN. If and when a draft statutory instrument is made, it will be assigned a new URI derived from its full SI number.
