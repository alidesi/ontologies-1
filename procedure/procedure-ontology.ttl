In this model, the procedure is analogous to a journey map to a set of potential destinations, a route is a set of directions on one of those journeys and a step is a waypoint."@en ;

ppr:Procedure rdf:type owl:Class ;
	rdfs:label "Procedure"@en ;
	rdfs:comment "A procedure in a House or Houses. For example, the passage of a made affirmative statutory instrument in both Houses. A procedure may consist of business in a particular House, such as a division; business undertaken by both Houses jointly, such as a joint committee; processes applying to either House, such as a time period; and activities outside Parliament, such as the making of a statutory instrument. In this model a procedure that consists of business in both Houses is considered as a single procedure."@en ;

ppr:Route rdf:type owl:Class ;
	rdfs:label "Route"@en ;
	rdfs:comment "A route with a type links a step or steps. To allow for changes in procedure over time, a route's start and end date are marked by means of startOn and endOn from the core ontology. A route is made traversable after the appropriate preceding step (linked via fromStep) is actualised by a business item having a date in the past."@en ;
	rdfs:isDefinedBy <http://parliament.uk/ontologies/procedure/> .
	
ppr:RouteType rdf:type owl:Class ;
	rdfs:label "RouteType"@en ;
	rdfs:comment "A route type is one of causes, allows, requires and precludes. A route with type 'causes' relates a preceding step (linked via fromStep) to a following step (linked via toStep) where actualisation of the preceding step by a business item with a date in the past causes the inevitability of the following step. A route with type 'allows' relates a preceding step to a following step where actualisation of the preceding step by a business item with a date in the past allows but does not cause the following step. A route with type 'requires' relates a preceding step to a following step where actualisation of the following step by a business item with a date in the past is necessary before the preceding step can happen. A route with type 'precludes' relates a preceding step to a following step where actualisation of the preceding step by a business item with a date in the past precludes the following step. Particular steps occur only once in a work package. For example, in the made affirmative statutory instrument procedure the step 'cleared by the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments' may happen only once. A route with the type 'precludes' may route a step to the same step. When a step is actualised by a business item with a date in the past, further instances of that step being actualised in the work package become precluded."@en ;

Note that whilst a work package can contain many business items, a business item might relate to several work packages e.g. a meeting of the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments might include business relating to many SI work packages with no distinct segmentation. Note also that the ordering of business items in a work package cannot be determined by the (end) date alone. Many business items inside a work package may share the same (end) date. In this case ordinality can only be determined by spanning the procedure tree, taking into account actualised steps and the route types joining steps to determine the real-world order."@en ;
